### Compilation
To get all binary files, just follow this instruction:
- if you haven't got the CMake utility installed yet, go to the [CMake Web Site](cmake.org) and download it;
- go to the directory `./build` (or create it using `mkdir` terminal command in case this directory doesn't exist);
- if you work under Windows:
    - go to the directory `/exe`;
- in case you work under MacOS / Linux:
    - go to the directory `/unix`;
- then type in the terminal the following commands:
```shell
cmake ../..
make
```
